CPP_Hive is a collection of files to develop an AI for the Software Challenge Germany 2019/2020.

I will not guarantee that this code is flawless. My aim tho is to create the most performant implementation possible.
If you find a bug, please contact me. If you have suggestions to improve the code, you may also contact me.
You may also improve on my code and never tell anyone, so you have the upper edge in the competition.

I wish happy coding with as little bugs as possible. (Pun intended) ;)
